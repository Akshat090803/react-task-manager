## üß™ Brief Testing Guidance

To quickly test the core functionalities:

1.  **Adding Tasks:**
    * Type a task in the input field.
    * A "Deadline" input will appear. Select a future date.
    * Click "Add Task".
    * **Test Validation:** Try adding an empty task or a task with a past date to see the alerts.

2.  **Task Operations:**
    * Hover over or click on a task to reveal edit/delete/complete options (if applicable).
    * Click the checkbox/button to mark a task as completed/pending.
    * Click the edit button to change the task description.
    * Click the delete button to remove a task.

3.  **Filtering:**
    * Click the "Filter" button.
    * Select different filter options ("All Tasks", "Pending", "Completed", "Created Today", "Due Today"). Observe how the displayed tasks and the summary message change.
    * Ensure "Created Today" and "Due Today" work correctly for tasks you've added/due today.

4.  **Sorting:**
    * Click the "Sort" button.
    * Select different sort options ("Oldest First", "Newest First", "Soonest Due", "Latest Due"). Observe the order of tasks in the list.
    * **Crucial Test:** Test sorting after applying a filter. The sorting should apply to the *currently filtered* tasks.

5.  **Persistence (localStorage):**
    * Add a few tasks.
    * Close your browser tab or refresh the page.
    * Verify that your tasks are still present.

6.  **Responsiveness:**
    * Resize your browser window to simulate different screen sizes (e.g., mobile).
    * Check if the layout adjusts correctly, and all elements remain accessible and usable.
